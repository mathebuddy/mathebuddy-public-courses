# Public Courses for the mathe:buddy app

This repository contains public courses for the mathe:buddy app.

- Each course is hosted in a separate directory.
- file `index.mbl` defines the course structure, as well as meta data (TODO: UNIMPLEMENTED!)
- Content files have the extension `.mbl` (mathe-buddy-language) which is specified [here](https://github.com/mathebuddy/mathebuddy-compiler) (TOOL: DOCUMENTATION WILL BE ADDED SOON)
- Refer to directories `demo-*/` for examples
